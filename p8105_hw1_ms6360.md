# Problem 1

``` r
library(tidyverse)
data("penguins", package = "palmerpenguins")
```

Here are some descriptions of the `penguins` dataset:

-   There are 344 observations of 8 variables (344 rows and 8 columns).

-   Each row depicts a penguin subject and there are 344 penguins
    studied.

-   The 8 variables that were measured are: species, island, bill length
    in mm, bill depth in mm, flipper length in mm, body mass in g, sex,
    and year of data collection.

-   The mean flipper length is 200.92.

Now, onto the scatterplot

``` r
ggplot(penguins, aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = flipper_length_mm, color = species)) + geom_point()
```

```

# Problem 2

Creating a dataframe to include:

-   a random sample of size 10 from a standard Normal distribution

-   a logical vector indicating whether elements of the sample are
    greater than 0

-   a character vector of length 10

-   a factor vector of length 10, with 3 different factor “levels”

``` r
my_df = 
  tibble(
    random = rnorm(n = 10),
    vec_logical = random > 0,
    vec_char = c("Hello", "my", "name", "is", "Maisie", "and", "here", "are", "few", "words"),
    vec_factor = factor(c("high", "middle", "low", "low", "high", "middle", "high", "low", "middle", "high"))
    )

mean(pull(my_df, random))
```

    ## [1] -0.1265759

``` r
mean(pull(my_df, vec_logical))
```

    ## [1] 0.4

``` r
mean(pull(my_df, vec_char)) 
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(my_df, vec_char)): argument is not numeric or
    ## logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

``` r
mean(pull(my_df, vec_factor))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(my_df, vec_factor)): argument is not numeric or
    ## logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

Running the code, numeric and logical vectors work and the means were
calculated. Character and factor vectors did not work. For the warning
message for character and factor vectors is “argument is not numeric or
logical: returning NA”.

When explicitly converting a logical, character, and factor variable to
numeric, it looks like this:

``` r
my_df = 
  tibble(
    random = rnorm(n = 10),
    vec_logical = random > 0,
    vec_char = c("Hello", "my", "name", "is", "Maisie", "and", "here", "are", "few", "words"),
    vec_factor = factor(c("high", "middle", "low", "low", "high", "middle", "high", "low", "middle", "high")),
    logical_num = as.numeric(pull(my_df, vec_logical)),
    char_num = as.numeric(pull(my_df, vec_char)),
    factor_num = as.numeric(pull(my_df, vec_factor))
    )
my_df

mean(pull(my_df, random))
mean(pull(my_df, logical_num))
mean(pull(my_df, char_num)) 
mean(pull(my_df, factor_num))
```

When running the code, no warning message was displayed. Logical, and
factor vectors that were converted into numeric vector had a mean
calculated. For the character vector, after being converted into
numeric, the values were all “NA”, which is appropriate because there
was no way to assign values to words.
